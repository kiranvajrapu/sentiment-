Was ""separated"" 2 months shy of collecting stock options, due to lack of work. Direct supervisor/Team lead was so inexperienced that he cost me my job. Had two separate opportunities lined up but when we met with the employer to discuss workflow, team lead was so inept that it hurt rather than helped. It was downright embarrassing. Needless to say, those jobs went to another outsourcing company. That left me jobless. When they brought me in to ""separate"" me, the HR rep was literally on her first week on the job. Could answer no questions, just gave me the business card for someone else if I had any questions. On top of that, the location manager who did the ""separation"" didn't even know my name or what department I worked in. 12 years and this guy couldn't care enough to even learn my name. That's great.Cyient has no HR department at all and really never has. It just isn't important to them. They are just looking for someone to bill the client for 40+ hours a week and don't really care about anything else. They go through the motions of employee engagement but there's no real commitment.

They will mention merit increases, but you will never get one regardless of how much you accomplish with the customer. The so called management is nothing more than timesheet approvers and it is very likely that they will have less experience and less professional mind-set than you will be lead to believe. In short, the little managers are just other contractors with the typical contractor competition mindset – so if you are unlucky enough to have to take a position, don’t be fooled.Honestly, this has been the worst professional decision of my career, I wanted to be near my family for a while, but I should have passed this job up; it is very easy to do better in this area or any other if you can just hold out a bit. There is no sense using a degree for the benefit of an Indian based company that rejects the value of human life as much as India does.

Couldn't even complain to HR as even the top level management guys are in good touch with the Managers. I did see few colleagues suffer.- You get no hikes (2-3% ) if some other project gets in the loss in the same vertical.- No career progression. Management doesn't motivate you to increase your skills. I was demotivated a lot.- There are a lot of managers over there who run the place as if they own it. No professionalism. They are the masters of politics.- Worst food you can ever get in any of the IT companies. Even after thousands of constructive feedbacks, management doesn't care. (Insects, uncooked food, rotten breakfast items etc.)- If your manager doesn't like you, simply they will demote you or stop your salary. Few fought back legally, won and resigned from the company. This happened with few of my colleagues.- No onsite opportunities for software people. If you belong to same caste or village of managers even with no proper skills, you are welcome onboard.- The manager never allows his/her associates to interact with the client to simply maintain dependency.- If you visit Finance or HR guys for any queries, you will be in shame. I had to approach numerous times to explain them their jobs keeping their managers in the loop. (Ex- PF transfer status is still pending from this company even after applying twice for more than a year.)I wasted my two years of hard work with no fruitful result or reward.

553, 27 Feb 2018,empReview_19446445,Former Employee - Senior Manager,I worked at Cyient full-time (Less than a year),"If you're smart enough to defend yourself, Cyient will go to any length to ensure that you're terminated.","At this moment, I cannot bring myself to think of anything that I can recommend.","I have never seen a HR team that works only for its employer and never for the emoloyees in need. Once you have a fallout with the management, that's it, you're done. They will ensure you are fired, to protect their so-called values. For a company that dwells on its 'values first' approach, I must ask, what values??? You say Fairness and Integrity, but where have you implemented fairness when your employees needed it to fight the malignant system? And integrity, I'm sure the organization is referring to strong moral values (which it clearly does not possess). If the only concern is to ensure to keep employees that are submissive and willing to dance to Cyient's tune, then yes, this organization has managed to ace it. They have never tolerated a single person who has lifted a finger against the management and its corrupt practices. As you can see, most of the other reviews here, all warn you that you may lose your job, at any time, despite your tenure and position. I shouldn't have taken those reviews lightly. I trusted the fine paint on the exterior, unaware of the huge cracks Cyient (Hyderabad) was housing, internally. I joined Cyient expecting to be a part of a wonderful and righteous organization, only to be fired after a tiring battle with their HR and management. I now know that the review, which calls this organization a 'death hole' is 100% true. You either just survive (miserably) or die here.Whatever your issue, the HR will ensure that it remains unresolved, if it's against the management. And then, the management and HR will quickly call out a reason to fire you. And mind you, their offer letter has a clause, which states that you can be fired, for no rhyme or reason, if the employer wishes so. And they will throw this clause in your face, when you ask for a reason!!!And I see how most of Cyient's responses to the reviews here are standard drafts, copy pasted from the previous reviews, talking about their values (like I've mentioned earlier) and offering to resolve issues by their HR team. Such a laudable effort by Cyient's reputation management team!!!","HR will be the reason for CYIENT's doom. One of these days, there will be someone who is man enough to stand up and fight back, and this will definitely expose the cracks in Cyient's system to the world, outside. I must say, however, Mr. Bodanappu and his father are very respectable gentlemen, who unfortunately are not directly involved in these matters. Their only chance to bring back integrity and fairness to the system would be to hit the 'refresh' button on HR. The entire employee management team needs to be either outsourced or like I mentioned earlier, refreshed. I genuinely wish the CEO all the very best.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/Cyient-Reviews-E145213.htm/Reviews/Employee-Review-Cyient-RVW19446445.htm

Every day, you have to log 9.5 hours at the office( whether there is work or no work, you have to clock 9.5 hours).3. Worst HR department. They don't know anything. They won't solve your problem. They make sure that the employees suffer. HR policies changes frequently and there is no transparency.4. Appraisals are a joke. Hikes are minimal and lower than industry standards.5. Non-negotiable notice period of 3 months.6. Joining package for a college fresher ranges from 1.9LPA to 2.5LPA.7. They don't provide medical insurance for employees. An amount would be deducted from the salary for medical insurance.8. Office cafeteria is worse. Only veg food is available and is unhygienic.9. Most of the managers are from defence background and they have limited technical knowledge. They have the worst people management skills.10. Projects are not that great. Mostly ""data-entry"" type of projects. No new technologies are involved in the execution of these projects.",Leadership is good but mid-level managers do not have any vision. They are totally ignorant of the latest technologies and industry trends.A complete overhauling of the mid-level management is required.
